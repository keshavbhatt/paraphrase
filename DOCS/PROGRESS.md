## 2026-10-22 - M0 measurements

- llama.cpp v0.7.0 built CPU only and CPU + Vulkan. Five candidates and the judge fetched by
  pinned revision and sha256 (`models.json`, `DOCS/models.md`).
- Eval harness, three skills (proofread, reply, rewrite with 9 tones) and 195 project-written
  eval items. No public dataset is used.
- Prompt revision 1: models answered English text in Hindi (Qwen3.5-4B rewrote 49 of 50
  English texts into Devanagari). Revision 2 removed Hindi from the system prompts and names
  the detected language in the user message: English drift went to 0 for every model.
- Revision 2 left two problems: proofread changed correct casual text (up to 6 of 12 clean
  items), and the professional rewrite translated Hinglish into English (3 to 5 of 7).
  Revision 3 addresses both; its eval, the judge (Sarvam-30B, tier-relevant pairs only) and
  the latency bench run overnight.
- Latency (revision 2, `eval/reports/m0-v2/summary.md`): no candidate meets the PLAN 5.4
  totals on A or B. The iGPU through Vulkan is slower than the CPU on this laptop.
- Waiting on the owner: the results table, the spot-check ratings, then the go/no-go and
  the revised latency targets.

## 2026-10-21 - M0 started

- Owner answers for M0 (recorded in `PLAN.md` section 11):
  - Q4: 8 GB CPU-only (machine A) is a must-have for the fast tier only (proofread, reply,
    format). The quality tier may be labelled "16 GB or GPU recommended" with a slower
    fallback on A. A no-go on A for the fast tier is fatal.
  - Machines: B is the development laptop (Intel Core Ultra 7 255U, 30 GB RAM, Intel
    Graphics (Arrow Lake) iGPU through Mesa Vulkan). A is emulated on the same laptop and its
    numbers are labelled "optimistic (emulated)"; re-run on a real older laptop before M5.
  - Q6: Hindi and Hinglish are a tie-breaker with a hard floor: reject a model that answers
    Hindi in English, breaks Devanagari, or rewrites Hinglish into English.
  - Q2: licensing as Omnidict, with the licensing module carve-out (ADR-002).
  - Eval data written for the project (no JFLEG in the repository), with room for about
    20 human-written items per skill in separate files, scored separately.
  - Judge: a model from a different family than the candidate it scores, blind pairwise,
    plus hard checks. The owner's spot-check of 20 outputs per model is the final word.
- Scaffold: git repository, licence files, editor and format config, Python tooling.
